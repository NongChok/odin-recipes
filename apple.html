<h3 class="recipe">Good way to use up extra apples</h3>
<p>This cake was easy and delicious. After reading all the reviews I was certainly torn; sweet apple vs tart apple, nuts vs no nuts, 2 cups sugar vs less sugar, frosting vs no frosting. What's a girl to do? Well, this is so unlike me, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was just right. I used 5 large Granny Smith apples. I think a tart apple is the way to go. </p>
<p>If you leave out the nuts, the cake is going to taste sweeter so you might want to adjust the sugar. And I can't imagine adding frosting to this cake, but to each his own. I served mine with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and got rave reviews from everyone. I will definitely be making this again and again.</p>
